# Smart-TV-site

Inside this directory is a small application along with the web crawlers and web scapers I utilised during my masters (conversion masters) dissertation in Computer Science

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Django (Python), MySQL and AWS 

Note: This project was completed last summer and is not representitative of my current Software engineering abilities. For a better reference, review the code 
that builds the 'Social Media' project. Despite this 'Social Media' being the first project where I have used React, it is still a better reflection of my current abilities as a full stack software engineer
