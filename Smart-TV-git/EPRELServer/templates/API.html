      <h1>API</h1>
      <h2 class="indented-paragraph" class="centerHeader" class="subHeaders"> About this API</h2>
      <br>

      <p class="indented-paragraph">The API for this website will allow clients to send json data specifying the location they are in, the time of day and what type of TV is being used. 
        In response the API will return the time of peak data traffic for that day. </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">Additionally, clients can also send the brands and model numbers of TVs to this API and in response, the API will 
          send the energy class of the TV from A to G with A representing energy efficient and G representing energy inefficiency. </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">If you are not within one of these areas, you can send a request to the API which will return the time of 
        average peak data traffic amongst all of these regions. If your users are not using a TV, please specify the attributes model and brand within the JSON request as 'null'. </p>

      <h2 class="indented-paragraph" class="subHeaders"> How to use the API</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">To use this API, please send JSON post request to the url: http://localhost:8000/api/</p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">Within this post request you need to write the attributes location, day, brand and model like so: </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        {
          "location": "outer london",
          "day": "saturday", 
          "brand": "samsung",
          "model": "HG50EJ690YA"
        }
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        To specify the location please use (location JSON attributes are case insensitive): <p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
          North America <br>
          London <br>
          Nairobi <br>
          Manchester <br>
          Scotland <br>
          Wales <br>
          Middle East
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        To specify the day please use any day of the week (do not input dates, inputs are also case insensitive):  
       To specify the brand please use the brand name. Examples of brands that would be recognized 
        include samsung, panasonic, TCL. Please note that brand names are case insensitive. 
       Please ensure that the model number is as accurate as possible as the model attribute of the JSON request is case sensitive. 
      Alternatively, if the device is not a TV, please specify the TV model and brand within the JSON request as 'null'.
      Another attribute for the API request which can be used is the tv_agent_string JSON attribute where users can place 
    the tv user agent string inside. </p>
      
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
      In response, the api will return a peak value which will represent the average peak data traffic time for that day.  The API will also return the overall energy class, the energy class in 
        standard dynamic range and the energy class in high dynamic range if a TV is both included within the JSON request and within the site's TV database and 
        in response the api will also return energy data corresponding to the user agent string if a tv user agent string is present within the API. Here is an example JSON request:
      </p>
      <p class="indented-paragraph">
        {
          "location": "middle east",
          "day": "saturday",
          "model": "T1931SAW-B5 B",
          "brand": "IIYAMA",
          "tv_agent_string": "Mozilla/5.0 (SMART-TV; Linux; Tizen 6.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) 4.0 Chrome/76.0.3809.146 TV Safari/537.36"
      } 
    </p>
